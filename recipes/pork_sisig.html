    <h2>About the dish</h2>
    <p>This dish is again from <strong>Kusina la Sofia's</strong> <em>exclusives,</em> the Pork Sisig.<br>
    During our college days when we used to go out on dates, we barely <br> had any money for anything expensive.
    So what we usually did was <br> I would cook us some food and we would just sit at the bay area and<br> have our dates there.
    She always loved my cooking and that's why<br> this dish is on the list for Top 3.</p>
