    <h2>About the dish</h2>
    <p>This dish is a staple in Filipino households. Whenever there's a fiesta and there is some leftover Lechon? <br>
        This is always the go to dish to not waste anything. That is why in <strong>Kusina la Sofia's</strong> <em>exclusive menu,</em>
        <br> this dish is a must have. Every paksiw has the same foundation of flavor, but depending on the ingredients 
        <br>and how you cook it, they differ in taste. So this dish, tastes different depending on the chef and culture. 
        <br>It's somewhat a personal dish that is why my wife loves mine so much. It reflects my personality and own 
        <br>take on the classic that is the Lechon Paksiw.
