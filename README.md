# sample-website-recipes
TheOdinProject Recipe Project

Practicing my HTML foundation by Creating a simple Recipe Website - The Odin Project Foundations.
It's a website that displays my top 3 dishes that my girl loves in a hypothetical restaurant that we own.
It's a little clunky and plain. Will come back to it as I progress through the course.

# UPDATE LOG: FIRST BUGS

    1. First issue i've encountered so far is that when running my websites locally, it works just fine. But after attempting to have it on GitHub pages, there's a few bugs that I need to squish out. 
        -Main page (index.html) won't redirect me to my sub pages (the recipes) when I click on each link.
        
        -Fixed the issue of directing me to the sub pages but in each page the images won't show up. BACK TO HOME link doesn't work too.
        
        -Everything works fine locally. (VS Code Live Server Extension)
